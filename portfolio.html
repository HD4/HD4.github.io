			<p> Hi guys! My name is Hill Dong, and I am a senior here at Ruben S. Ayala High School. 
				Coding is something mysterious to me even though I've encountered it before. 
				I took a whole class on coding under Mr. Boren but to be honest, I retained absolutely nothing from that class. I am here in Mr. Pittman's class to expand upon my tiny prexisting knowledge in computer principles and hopefully gain many new skills to bring with beyond high school. I'm looking forwards to having a great year in Computer Science!
			</p>
			<p> As you can tell I enjoy gaming so add my steam. I really suck but I enjoy yelling obscenities at other players.
				I am also on the Ayala swim team so if you want to see me in a manly speedo join the team. Besides that I don't really have much besides school.
			<p> Here I have another Super Saiyan, Kobe Steak </p>
